In this step, I have deleted dist folder and run ng build --prod again
angular build app in a subfolder inside dist directory hence I copied all the content from the subdirectory which contains index.html to dist/.

ng build --prod
firebase deploy
firebase open hosting:site

# cambios en firebase.json
public : "dist/clientes-app"
destination : "/dist/index.html"
